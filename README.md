<!-- Hi! Read below -->

This collection of HTML, CSS, and Javascript serves two purposes: to fulfill a graduation requirement for a Front End Web Development track with Code Louisville, and to serve as the source of the UofL Classical Guitar Program's web presence. Right now this rough draft website is stocked with meaningless filler content. After I add the finishing touches and submit this code to github for review by Code Louisville personel, this website will likely go live. Prior to launching the site, all filler content will be swapped out with true content.

This site is not perfect. Gallery, audio, and events pages are still in progress: the CSS is not as refined on these pages. The audio page is in dire need of optimization...Right now, the front page is where the magic is at. The day has come, to judge a book by its cover.

<!-- Oh hey. There's nothing left to read here...-->

<!-- This comment is truly pointless. I just like to type. -->
